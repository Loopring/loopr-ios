### Development 

##### Stack

- No storyboard. It's ok to use xib in the early development. However, if the UI is complicated, please write UI programmatically.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios): an iOS library to natively render After Effects vector animations
- [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop): An extensible iOS and OS X animation library, useful for physics-based interactions.
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
- [SwiftTheme](https://github.com/jiecao-fm/SwiftTheme): Powerful theme/skin manager
